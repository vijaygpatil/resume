						<p>I am a July 29th born and that makes me Leo. And yes I am a
							true leo who likes to be lavish, loving, charming, magnanimous,
							creative, faithful and honest. Go straight and turn right is
							always what I strive for. I don’t like to settle for second best
							anytime. I only want the best which can cause lavish excessive
							spendings to me but I like to enjoy the life of luxury.</p>
						<p>I currently work at Garmin International as Application
							Developer. I am a Computer Science professional and have a
							Masters Degree in Computer Science with specialization in
							Software Engineering. I did my masters at Illinois Institute of
							Technology, Chicago.</p>
						<p>I am very passionate about Java programming. I like to read
							about new technologies and how these technologies simplify human
							life. I have a good collection of music which I like to carry
							with me always. If I am in a good mood, I can cook awesome. I can
							watch movies back to back if I have to kill time. I like to keep
							my own collection of movies. I like to go on long drives
							sometimes. I love to go to different places and have fun. I like
							swimming and bowling too. I can read books only if it gives me
							some real knowledge. I don’t like to read fiction.</p>
						<p>I was born in Maharashtra, India. My dad is a state
							government officer and my mom is a housewife. I have a elder
							sister and a younger brother. My sister, Hemalata is married and
							she has a boy. She teaches in a school. My brother, Dhiraj is
							also married and has a girl. He supervises horticulture for a
							very good hotel in Pune, Maharashtra. I feel sad that none of
							them are here with me. I love them so much.</p>
						<p>I did my schooling in a school named Vidya Niketan, in a
							small town by name Dombivali in Maharashtra. I never used to get
							good grades in Vidya Niketan because all day play and no study is
							the only thing I did in school. Later I realized that everyone
							has to be serious in life. I managed to get good grades in Higher
							Secondary School and got into a entirely new world of college. I
							got into a good University College - K J Somaiya College of
							Engineering to pursue my Bachelors Degree.</p>
						<p>Life as a undergrad was fun. I realize that those four
							years were the most wonderful years of my life. They were full of
							ups and downs, successes and failures, creativity and blunders.
							Besides the undergrad studies, I use to get myself involved into
							small electronic projects. FM transmitter, Clap Switch,
							Electronic greeting card with a Happy Birthday tune in it,
							repairing a broken speaker - it was all fun and exciting. Friends
							were the best part. I met some life time friends in Somaiya.</p>
						<p>After college I went to Banglore for my first job as a
							software developer. First job is always exciting for everyone.
							Bangalore was a blast. I had money to spend. Shopping malls,
							movies, night clubs, picnics, restaurants was life. If I have to
							return back to India, Bangalore is the place I would live rest of
							my life. After 2 years of job I realized that my knowledge of
							software was insufficient to excel in this field. So I shifted my
							gears and landed in United States to do Masters in Computer
							Science at Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago.</p>
						<p>My early days in Chicago were bit hectic because I had to
							study and do job as well so that I could incur some of my
							expenses. It was bit difficult to get back to studies after 2
							years of job but I was glad I could get good grades. Met some new
							friends at IIT. I never felt alone in this big country.</p>
						<p>Life here in US is very fast. I have completed my Masters
							and I am already more than 2 years experienced here. I presently
							work as a Application developer in Garmin International. I guess
							I am used to this fast and hectic life now. I regret that the
							golden days of college have gone but I am excited of new
							challenges and opportunities ahead. Happy-Sad me.</p>
